                                                                                MODULE 1 -INTRODUCTION



*Concepts and characterstics of DBMS:
 ------------------------------------


* Data==> Raw facts,unprocessed facts. 
  Eg: teja, 75 B+

* Information ==>Refined dats.
  Eg: teja has passed with 75% and obtained B+ grade.

* Database  ==>collection of related data.

*Metadata ==> Definition of data(more information about data).
  Eg:constraints


*Functionalities of DBMS:

  Define      ==>specifying the datatype,structure and constraints for the data to be stored.
  Construct   ==>process of storing data on some storage medium.
  Manipulate  ==>Quering the database to retrieve specific data, updating database and generating database.
  Share        ==>Allows multiple users and programs to access the database concurrently.



*Properities of DBMS:

  *A database represents some ascepts of real world.
  *A database is a logically coherent collection of data with some meaning.
  *A database is designed , bult and  populated with data for a specific purpose.


*Need of DBMS:

  *Processing quiries and object management.
  *controlling redundancy and inconsistency.
  *Efficient memory management and indexing.
  *concurrency control and Transcation management.
  *Access control and ease in accessing data.
  *Integrity constraints.


*Characteristics of DBMS:

  *Self Describing nature of a database system.
  *Insulation b/w programs and data and data abstraction.
  *Support of multiple views of data.
  *sharing of data and  multiuser transcation processing.


*Advantages of using DBMS:

  *Controlling Redundancy.
  *Restricting unauthorized access.
  *PRoviding persistent storage for program objects.
  *Providing Backup and Recovery.
  *providing multiple user Interfaces.
  *Representing complex relationships among Data.
  *Enforcing Integrity constraints.
  *permitting Inferencing and actions using rules.



*Disadvantages of using DBMS:

  *The cost of Hardware and Software of DBMS are quite high,  which increases the budget of the organization.
  *Most DBMS are Often complex , so training users  to use the DBMS  is required.
  *DBMS cannot perform sophiscated calculations.



*When not to use DBMS:

  *Overhead  costs of using Database Management system.
    *High initial investment.
    *Overhead for providing security.
    *Concurrency control and recovery.











*History and Evolution of Database:
----------------------------------


  *Types of Database:

    *Hierarchical Database:

      *Tree-like structure.
      *Top-down or Bottom-up structure.
      *parent-child relationship-Parents may have many childern,but childern have only one parent.

  *  Network Database:

    *Grap structure accessed through several paths.
    *Each child can have multiple parents.
    *More complex relationships.


  *Relational Database:

    *Easiset and most wiedly used model.
    *Normalize data in rows and columns of the tables.
    *Fixed structures and manipulated using SQL.



  *Object-oriented database:

    *Data stored in the form of objects.
    *classes with data within it.
    *stores both, datamembers values and operation
